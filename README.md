# Payment gateway based on the Full Cycle project
 
 ## About the project
 
 This project was developed during the [Full Stack & Full Cycle Immersion](https://imersao.fullcycle.com.br/evento/), where we built a complete Payment Gateway using microservices architecture.
 
 The aim is to demonstrate the construction of a modern distributed system, with separation of responsibilities, asynchronous communication and real-time fraud analysis.
 
 
 ### System components
 
 -  Gateway (Go)
    - Setup and basic project structure
    - Account management endpoints (creation and consultation)
    - Complete invoice system with:
    - Automatic payment creation and processing
    - Validation of limits (invoices > R$ 10,000 are pending)
    - Individual consultation and listing of invoices
